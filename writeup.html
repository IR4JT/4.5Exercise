            I used ChatGPT 5.2 in my browser to help me and also Gemini when using ChatGPT. When I was stuck I gave it my code and it rewrote it for me. For example, I gave this prompt with code following it, “for my writeup page can you help fix it like the text is not looking good?” it then made a writeup page for me. I did not use the code it gave as I wanted to use Geminis to see how it worked. However, I did use ChatGPT for the index and it did rewrite everything when I asked it for help but I just could not get it to work without it’s doing. I realized that when it takes my code it uses or really tries to keep my wording and style though it completely loses it after a couple rewrites and it messes up. I went back through the code and did some fixing. I believe ChatGPT is really good as a starting tool and maybe a brainstormer though in class we talked about how it has no original ideas so maybe not a good brainstormer not sure.

            I also used Gemini 3 Pro for help. I used the same prompts as with ChatGPT I used, “for my writeup page can you help fix it like the text is not looking good?” Gemini is a bit different. It likes to add details, colors, and graphics. Geminis outputs look more UI focused ChatGPT does not do a lot of UI it is more clean and simple. If you look at my index.html code I had Gemini help me but it was so much code it confused me it is the text that is commented out. Interestingly enough Gemini told me to watch a YouTube for help with the API the video was called How to create an aviation app with an aviation data API | aviationstack. And it gave a tutorial on how to use the API keys and code from the video. Honestly, very cool for help and understanding.
